# zk-ga-integration
Sample code for analytics integration in ZK

This project can be built with Maven (see pom.xml) and run with jetty or in a local webserver (tomcat, etc)

This project uses Google Analytics.
To successfully initialize a page with GA, an API ID is required
See the GA documentation for more details

All scripts in this project use a generic XX-00000000-0 ID which should be replaced by an actual ID for testing.
